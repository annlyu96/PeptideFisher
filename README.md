# Peptide-to-protein data aggregation using Fisher’s method improves target identification in chemical proteomics 
R implementation of peptide-level statistical testing in proteomics using Fisher’s method to combine peptide p-values. This approach avoids biases from deviant or missing peptides and improves detection of regulated or shifted proteins compared with traditional protein-level analyses.
